# This setting controls the target era for your shard.
# This allows you to develop expansion-specific features.
# This value is also used to infer some aspects of the network communications; 
# which values should and shouldn't be sent to clients dependend on their versions.
# Setting this value does not guarantee that all features and content will behave as
# expected for that expansion - some modifications may be needed for accuracy.
# ServUO content always attempts to reflect the latest version of the official servers.
# Backward compatibility with old expansions is not maintained by the ServUO team.
# Leaving this blank will select the latest expansion.

# If all of your local IP addresses are private network addresses and AutoDetect is 'true'
# then ServUO will attempt to discover your public IP address for you automatically.
AutoDetect=true

# If you do not plan on allowing clients outside of your LAN to connect, 
# you can set AutoDetect to 'false' and leave Address set to 'null'.
#
# If your public IP address cannot be determined, you must change the value 
# of Address to your public IP address
# manually to allow clients outside of your LAN to connect to your server. 
# Address can be either an IP address or a hostname that will be resolved 
# when ServUO starts.
#
# If you want players outside your LAN to be able to connect to your server 
# and you are behind a router, 
# you must also forward TCP port 2593 to your private IP address. 
# The procedure for doing this varies by manufacturer but generally involves 
# configuration of the router through your web browser.
# Default: 127.0.0.1
