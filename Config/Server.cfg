# The default setting for Address, a value of 'null', will use your local IP address.
# If all of your local IP addresses are private network addresses and AutoDetect is 'true'
# then ServUO will attempt to discover your public IP address for you automatically.
AutoDetect=True

# If you do not plan on allowing clients outside of your LAN to connect, 
# you can set AutoDetect to 'false' and leave Address set to 'null'.
#
# If your public IP address cannot be determined, you must change the value 
# of Address to your public IP address
# manually to allow clients outside of your LAN to connect to your server. 
# Address can be either an IP address or a hostname that will be resolved 
# when ServUO starts.
#
# If you want players outside your LAN to be able to connect to your server 
# and you are behind a router, 
# you must also forward TCP port 2593 to your private IP address. 
# The procedure for doing this varies by manufacturer but generally involves 
# configuration of the router through your web browser.
@Address=


# If your server is running in an environmentwhere the process see's a different
# IP Address than the IP address your LAN clients should connect to (such as
# Docker) you need to specify the address that LAN clients will connect to. This
# address should be (or resolve to) the Docker host IP or other IP that clients
# actually see.
@PrivateAddress=

# The Port to bind the Listener to.
# Default: 2593
@Port=2593
