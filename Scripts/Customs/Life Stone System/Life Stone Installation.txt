Installation

1. Drop the "Life Stone System" folder into your Customs directory.
2. Find the following line in your PlayerMobile.cs file

Code:
base.OnDeath(c);
Directly under that, place this bit of code.

Code:
#region Life Stone Edit Begin
            for (int i = 0; i < LifeStoneCore.LifeStoneList.Count; i++)
            {
                if (LifeStoneCore.LifeStoneList[i].LifeStoneOwner == this)
                {
                    if (LifeStoneCore.LifeStoneList[i].Stone.UsesRemaining > 0)
                    {
                        this.SendGump(new LifeStoneReturnGump(this, LifeStoneCore.LifeStoneList[i].Stone));
                    }
                }
            }
            #endregion Life Stone Edit End
3. Restart your shard and use [LSConfig or [LifeStoneConfig to set it up, then issue your stones how ever you want.
