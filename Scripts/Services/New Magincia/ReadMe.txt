To generate these systems, say [GenNewMagincia

[DeleteNewMagincia will not work, not by default.

The login behind this, is deleting the control item for the plot lotto system or the bazzar system could potentially piss alot of players off who have time, gold and 
items invested.  As a shard owner, if you want to disable a system, simple disable from the props gump, and delete the items associated with each system, such as the 
posts, etc.
