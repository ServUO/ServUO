                 * zealots against those who imprisoned him. With the strength of this fallen star Khal Ankur would be
                 * impossible to kill, save for with the very power the fallen star gives to Khal Ankur. You must never
                 * allow Khal Ankur to rise again, lest the cultists may use their power to recall the Titans to this
                 * world! The fallen star is rich with a material called Caddellite, which gives Khal Ankur unmatched
                 * power. I hope you know a good tinker, as Caddellite is a fiercely strong material that is otherwise 
                 * impossible to harvest. With Caddellite infused resources you will be able to supply an army of the
