This is an example of the use of the new <b>GETFROMFILE</b> keyword that allows text to be read directly from a file into XmlSpawner2 strings.

<br>
<h2><basefont color=#ffff00>How to use it</basefont></h2>
<br>
<br>
You can use these strings almost anywhere, not just in gumps like this. 
<br>Basically, anywhere that any of the other GET keywords could be used will also support this.
<br>
<br>
This can be used to provide dynamic content that can be updated purely through file manipulation.
<br>
<br>
For example, try editing the welcome.txt file and saying 'help' again (make sure you are a player).  You will see the changes in this gump immediately.
