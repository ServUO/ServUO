[b]SUMMARY[/b]
This set of attachments provides a system for allowing objects and structures to be damaged by siege weapons and repaired by siege tools.  

[b]DESCRIPTION:[/b]

This system makes use of the XmlSpawner2 attachment system and the XmlSpawner2 package must be installed to support it.  You dont need to use the xmlspawners themselves, and it doesnt matter whether you use the standard distribution spawners or any other spawning system but you do need the XmlSpawner2 package installed.

Because the attachment system neither requires nor makes any changes to serialization/deserializations of any item or mobile, it can be safely added and removed at any time now or in the future without interfering with any other systems that you might have installed.


[b][u]Features:[/u][/b]

Note that ANY object can in principle be made damageable - walls, doors, signs, trees, doors, addons - anything.  You just have to tag them with the xmlsiege attachment. 

[u]SiegeRepairHammer[/u] -  Just double-click to use and target the siege-able object to be repaired.  It can be given either limited (set UsesRemaining to a value > 0) or unlimited number of uses (set UsesRemaining to a value < 0).
You must have the required resources to repair the targeted object.  The default setting is to repair 10 hits of damage per use.

[u]SiegeCannon[/u] - To use the siege cannon just place it on the ground.
To move it, you must first store it in your pack.  To do this, select the Backpack context menu option.
The Next/Previous options allow you to change the facing of the cannon.  The cannon can target objects in a 90 degree arc in front of it.  
To use the cannon, first you must load a cannonball into it by double clicking a cannonball, then selecting the cannon.
Once a cannonball is loaded, you can fire the cannon by double clicking it and then selecting a target object (either a mobile or item).  You must be nearby to do this.
The accuracy of the shot depends on the distance of the object, the ArmsLore skill of the operator, and the type of cannonball used.
The maximum range of the shot depends on the type of munition used.  
Different cannonball types will have different accuracy modifiers, range, area damage, damage types, and firing speed.
The minimum time between shots will be affected by the firing speed of the ammunition and the dexterity of the operator.

[b][u]Making items damageable[/u][/b]

[u]Manually to individual item/mobs [/u]

- the XmlSiege attachment can be added to objects in several ways.  It can be manually attached to any existing object with the "[addatt" command.

For example

"[addatt xmlsiege 200"

will add 200 siege hits to a targeted object.


[u]To spawned objects[/u]

- To add the attachment to spawned objects use the ATTACH keyword in spawn entries such as this

static,87/ATTACH/xmlsiege,100

which would spawn a wall segment with 100 hit points.
