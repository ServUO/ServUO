        to know. At least all you'll need to know for now. Haha!<br><br>Knowing about how living things work inside 
        can be a very useful skill. Not only can you learn where to strike an opponent to hurt him the most, but you 
        can use what you learn to heal wounds better as well. Just walking around town, you can even tell if someone 
        is strong or weak or if they happen to be particularly dexterous or not.<BR><BR>If you're interested in learning 
        more, I'd advise you to head out to Old Haven, just to the east, and jump into the fray. You'll learn best by 
        engaging in combat while keeping you and your fellow adventurers healed, or you can even try sizing up your 
        opponents.<br><br>While you're gone, I'll dig up something you may find useful. */
