I hate to trouble you, but sometimes a problem needs a plow and sometimes it needs a sword. I am good with a plow, but terrible with a sword. 
        I have been plagued with a strange weed for some time. Every day I have to clean them out of my garden and carry them away with my pitch fork. Yesterday I was working there and… well, I must have nodded off because when I woke my pitchfork was gone! 
        I have heard talk of thieves who seek treasure in the sacred tomb, but I really don’t think they took my pitchfork, in fact I think it just got lost in the weeds! 
        I would find it myself, but now that we are so close to the edge of the world, many wild creatures are lurking about and some might be hiding in these weeds. I’ve seen the creatures that have been roaming these parts recently and I fear for my life! The problem is, if I don’t get my crop in the ground soon, we won’t make it through the winter. Will you help?*/
