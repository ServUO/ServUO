* Eh? Who is it? Who's there?  Come to trouble an old woman have you?<BR><BR>
* 
* I'll split ye open and swallow yer guts!  I'll turn ye into a pile
* o' goo, I will!  Bah!  As if I didn't have enough to worry about.  As if I've
* not enough trouble as it is!<BR><BR>
* 
* Another of my blasted apprentices has gone missing!  Foolish children,
* think they know everything.  I should turn the lot of them into toads -
* if only they'd return with their task complete!  But that's the trouble, innit?
* They never return!<BR><BR>
* 
* But you don't care, do ye?  I suppose you're another one of those meddlesome kids,
* come to ask me for something?  Eh?  Is that it?  You want something from me,
* expect me to hand it over?  I've enough troubles with my apprentices, and that
* vile imp, Zeefzorpul!  Why, I bet it's him who's got the lot of them!  And who
* knows what he's done?  Vile little thing.<BR><BR>
* 
* If you expect me to help you with your silly little desires, you'll be doing
* something for me first, eh?  I expect you to go seek out my apprentice.
* I sent him along the road west of here up towards Yew's graveyard, but he never
* came back. Find him, and bring him back, and I'll give you a little reward that
* I'm sure you'll find pleasant.<BR><BR>
* 
* But I tells ye to watch out for the imp name've Zeefzorpul!  He's a despicable
* little beast who likes to fool and fiddle with folk and generally make life
* miserable for everyone.  If ye get him on your bad side, you're sure to end up
* ruing the day ye were born. As if you didn't already, with an ugly mug
* like that!<BR><BR>
* 
* Well, you little whelp?  Going to help an old hag or not?
