        /*Greetings, adventurer.  Our  queen has need of your services again, should you be willing to come to her aid.<br><br>	
		As you may know, her Majesty has spent the past thousand years diligently researching ways in which she could defeat the
		Defiler.  I have personally assisted her in this effort and we have discovered a ritual which will magnify the cleansing
		magic that she originally used against him, potentially breaking the barrier that protects the Defiler’s body from harm.
		<br><br>	The ritual is ancient, dangerous, and requires many obscure components that are not easy to obtain. Her 
		Majesty has been successful in acquiring all but five of them over the years but, now, time is running out and she has
		asked me to task you with their acquisition. I have been provided with a list of the five remaining components and would
		like you to obtain them.<br><br>	The first component that I require is a handful of scales from a Dream Serpent.<br><br>
		Dream Serpents are mischievous but benevolent creatures that live off of magical energy.  They are extremely rare and 
		hard to catch, preferring to live in the realm of dreams rather than the physical realm. However, there is one location
		within the kingdom that you may find one.<br><br>	Journey once again to the Southwestern Flight Tower.  On your way to
		the Athenaeum, you may have noticed a clearing surrounded by four hillocks. This location is an intersection of ley lines
		which run throughout Ter Mur.  Ley lines are energized, concentrated strands of magical energy and thus they are 
		irresistible to the creatures.  If my calculations are correct, you should find a serpent and be able to interact with the
		creature. Heed my warning, adventurer: you should not seek to harm the beast. Offensive tactics must be avoided at all 
		costs, as these magical beings help keep the very energy of Ter Mur harnessed and in balance. Speak with the creature and
		ask for its aid, but do not harm it. When you have acquired the scales, return to me and I shall reward you and guide you
		towards the second component.*/
