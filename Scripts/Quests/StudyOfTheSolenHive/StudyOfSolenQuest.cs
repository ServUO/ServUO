* 
* Um..yes..excuse me. I was wondering if you could offer me a bit of assistance.
* You see, I'm a naturalist of some repute - a gentleman and a scholar if you
* will - primarily interested in the study of insects and arachnids. While I've
* written a few interesting books on the marvelous Terathan race and their bizarre
* culture, now I've heard tales of a truly significant new discovery!<BR><BR>
* 
* Apparently a race of ant-like creatures known as the Solen have appeared in
* our world, scuttling up from some previously hidden home. Can you believe it?
* Truly these are amazing times! To a scholar such as myself this is indeed
* an exciting opportunity.<BR><BR>
* 
* That said, while I may be a genius of some reknown, sharp as a tack and quick
* with the quill, I'm afraid I'm not much of the adventuring type. Though I have
* gained assistance before, I still have many unanswered questions.<BR><BR>
* 
* I am particularly interested in the Solen Egg Nests that are studiously
* protected by the Solen workers. If you would be so kind as to assist me,
* I would ask that you travel into the Solen Hive and inspect each of the
* Solen Egg Nests that reside within. You will have to spend some time examining
* each Nest before you have gathered enough information. Once you are done,
* report back to me and I will reward you as best as I can for your valiant
* efforts!<BR><BR>
* 
* Will you accept my offer?
