		To survive, I have had to sell much of my family’s property. Most of it was meaningless, but I regret that a
		few years ago I made a terrible mistake. I pawned a shield bearing my family’s coat of arms to a loan shark.
		That shield was borne into battle by Jaan de Boors, the founder of our house! It has no value to anyone, but
		that blackguard won’t believe I have no money. He wants a fortune in jewels before he will return it.
		Now I have learned that I am dying. Soon I will be gone, and my lineage with me. For the sake of what little
		honor is left to me and my family name, I cannot bear to leave our ancestral shield in the hands of that villain.
		Will you help me recover it? */
