	<h3>Claim System version 2.1, by Xanthos</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>The Claim System rewards users for helping keep item count down thereby reducing lag. As corpses are claimed, the player is given the looted items as well as a gold reward based on the fame of the mob. The system also helps make looting corpses and scavenging items from the ground less tedius by automating the tasks. The system can be configured to keep looting of player corpses and competing for loot a social activity by disallowing its use when other players are within a ceratin radius. The system comes with a special gold bag that looted/scavenged gold is placed into with the Auction system and all gold within will be deposited into the account; saving the tedium of dragging piles of gold to the account. The system honors the notoriety system and will not loot high fame mobs for which rights have not been earned. A player is always free to loot by hand those corpses that the system will not loot. The system requires <strong>no</strong> modifications to the standard distro files.</p>
	<h4>Features</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>A [claim command that enables targeted selection of corpses to loot</li>
		<li>Cursor retargets after each corpse is claimed allowing rapid claiming of multiple corpses</li>
		<li>A [grab command that enables area wide looting and item scavenging of gold, silver and loot bags, players can keep in their packs, that looted/scavenge gold silver and loot are placed into automatically</li>
		<li>When possible stackable items are stacked as they are moved to the player's pack or gold bag</li>
		<li>Corpses of bonded pets cannot be looted/scavenged, preventing a possible exploit</li>
		<li>Each player can set the types of the items that their loot bag will collect. Using the -t option a gump will be presented allowing them to add or remove item types from the list of those collected.</li>
