	<h3>Luck and Runic Properties Fix 1.0 by Xanthos</h3>
	<h4>The Problem</h4>
	<p>Loot dropped by mobs on death is generated by the Server.Items.BaseRunicTool class. This class also provides the base code for generating items created in game using the crafting tools. The scale method is used to scale up the base intensities on items generated by this base class. The scale method that comes with the distro files is buggy and instead of scaling up can actually scale intensities down. The result is that both dropped loot and runic crafted items will have poor intensities due to the scale method. Moreover, luck does not provide any improvement in the quality of the items.</p>
	<h4>The Solution</h4>
	<p>The modified file BaseRunicTool.cs implements the scale method in such a way as to produce results, for loot generation and runic crafting, similar to those of EA shards.</p>
	<h4>To Use or Not?</h4>
	<p>Use of this modified BaseRunicTool.cs file is optional - if you choose not to use it, simply remove it. Otherwise, if you choose to use this file, remove the distro file with the same name.</p>
