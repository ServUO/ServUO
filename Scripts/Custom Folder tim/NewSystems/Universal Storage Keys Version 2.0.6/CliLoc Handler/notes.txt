ChangeLog:
==========

version 2012-02-15
	-Added Export button to the CliLocViewer, which exports the currently filtered list to a text file in the RunUO root directory (output.txt).

Version 2008-10-07
	-Fixed a typo that caused a compile error if you don't have the Universal Storage Keys project installed

Version 2008-10-06
	-Added gump CliLocViewerGump which lists and filters cliloc strings, along with their corresponding numbers.  This
	is accessible through the Developer command [clilocviewer

Version 2008-09-11
	-Switched cliloc data storage object from List<> to Hashtable.  This drastically reduces the time taken finding
	the string, and will minimize the execution time of intensive, repetitive use.


Version 2008-09-08
	-initial release
	
Compatibility:
--------------

This was developed using a freshly downloaded RunUO 2.0 SVN server, and has also been tested on a RunUO 2.0 RC1 server/

*RunUO 2.0 SVN version 300 (downloaded October 7, 2008)
*RunUO 2.0 RC1


Notes:
------

This tool requires a copy of a client's cliloc.enu (default language) file.  If you have a client, you can provide this.

If you wish to use another localization file than the .enu file, there are notes on how to do this later.	

This project is more of a stub project, as it was developed for the Universal Storage Keys project.  There may be some use of it for
other projects, so I am releasing it as a standalone project.


Overview:
---------

The CliLoc reader tool provides a few easy-to-use methods for reading and assembling client localization text strings.  These can be helpful when
trying to display information like the ObjectPropertyList information given when the client mouses over an item or mobile.  

There is also a gump, "ObjectPropertyListGump" which synthesizes the client's display of the object property list.


Installation:
-------------

To install this package:
	-drop the script files somewhere in the Scripts folder of your RunUO installation
	-place a copy of the client's cliloc.enu file somewhere in your RunUO installation
	

Using Methods:
--------------

The main class that is useful is the Solaris.ClilocHandler.CliLoc class.  The following briefly describes the accessible methods of interest 
within this class:

public static string GetName( object o )
	-returns a string containing the first line in the object property list of specified object "o"

public static List<string> GetPropertiesList( object o )
	-returns a list of strings containing all the object property list entries of specified object "o"

	
There are more methods available, but these two are most likely the only you will ever wish to use.  To implement these methods in your code, 
or to implement any of the other ones found in the CliLoc class, be sure to include a "using" directive like the following:


using Solaris.ClilocHandler;
	

Using Gumps:
------------
	
The ObjectPropertyListGump provides a synthesized version of the client's object property list, like when you mouse over or click an item/mobile.
To use the gump, follow this example.


Mobile mobile;				//the player to receive the gump
Item item;					//the item to display 

mobile.SendGump( new ObjectPropertyListGump( mobile, item ) );


Other Languages:
----------------

If you wish to use another language, open the file CliLocDAO.cs, and change the filename on line 53 to whichever localization file you wish to use.
