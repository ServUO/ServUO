body of the part to go in the forums

Set of Training "Dummies"

This set of traing dummies, takes the origional one in game, and add a whole new dimension to traing :)
each sub set includes 3 types, basic, enhanced & advanced (except for normal weapon one, it has 2 and the basic one is the one all ready in game)

besides the weapon ones, these are made to reward the non-afk/non-macro'er out and train faster

they also give other ways that you can set up for training these skills besides just sitting there and using the skill on an item/mobile
and they can make you laugh at the same time

Now the basics on them:

each sub set has 3 types:
basic - no extra part in anme - trains up to 25 skill level like the normal training dummies do
enhanced - will train up to 100 skill
advanced - will train from 100 up to 160 skill (or cap - which ever is lower)
all 3 values can be easiely modified in the script or in game indiovidualy by item

the sets are:
weapons (lust like the current in game training dummy, the basicc one not included since you have) - this one does not use gumps and is not friendlier to non afk'ers

Item ID - made to train up item id of course
Arms lore
Animal Lore
Tactics
Anatomy

How they work :)

double click like normal
starts it swinging
if weapon one, works like normal for its range
if not weapon one open up the gump for it
finsihes up :)

the Gump
It displays a question based on the type of skill being raised
also displays pictures that go along with the question
then displays 6 possible answers and a cancel button (note -cancle button still can do a skill check)
only right clicking will not do a skill check

once a button is pushed, it does a skill check, with possible skill gain
then depening if right or wrong answer:
wrong answer - sends the player a message saying basicaly they goofed
if right answer - does a bonus skill check for an other possible gain and a saying to tell them they where basicaly right

these are all SIMPLE questions & answers, these are ment more for training and to give a person doing it a laugh

all of the sayings are ment to be on the funny side, and can be easiely modified in the scripts to add/remove or change them around

so they can macro it, but only 1 in 6 change of being correct
so those that sit there and actualy take the time to read it and select the correct answer, get a full double bonus of skill gain
and once they get going at it, the item wil be waiting on them

side note - the things that is says also if you try to use to fast, while mounted, etc are also ment to be funny

these are great for guild houses, newbie dungeons, or for shards that have skills go beyond the normal 100 for these skills

they can be added to the crafting menu easiely, or added as rare loot on a critter, or being sold by a vendor

they also come in east & south versions :)

The main documentaion for these is in the anatomy ones, with only major changes noted in the other ones where needed - no use in repeating the same wording many many times (just be a lot of copy & pasting or me wearing out my fingers :rolleyes: )

enjoy and have fun with it
and as always, can modify, mutalate, spindle, delete or what ever you want to these to make them useful for your shard
