Hello all,

 I have been working on a Project only known as codename 'Blackrock' for quite some time and thought I would make this public, thanks for your time reading this and feel free to post any suggestions.

 This is a custom command called 'Record Items' that simply records all non movable items in the current region, saving them to a text file located in your UO server directory called region.txt.

 Special thanks to Knives aka Kmwill23

 Installation:

 Simply drop into a custom directory in your UO server.
 Adds command [recorditems to your server

 Sincerely,

 Jay Keening
