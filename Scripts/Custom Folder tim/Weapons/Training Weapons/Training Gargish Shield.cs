/*********************************************************************
 * 
 * The original weapon pack was posted to RunUO on 18AUG2005 by Triple. 
 * http://www.runuo.com/community/threads/training-weapons.57430/ 
 * 
 * It included: Training Katana, Training Kryss, Training Mace, and Training Bow.
 * 
 * I added the Training Buckler, Training Gargish Boomerang, Training Gargish Kryss,
 * Training Gargish Mace, Training Gargish Shield, and Training Gargish Sword. 
 * 
 * I had to work on them some to get all the Special Abilities to work. Now you can use 
 * your specials to get your mana down, so you can work your Meditation and Focus while 
 * training fighting skills. When used in conjunction with Training Elementals you can 
 * set up a nice training area. Hopefully you will find this script in a package with the set.
