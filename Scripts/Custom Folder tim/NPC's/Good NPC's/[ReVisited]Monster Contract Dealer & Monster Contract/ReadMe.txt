Monster Contract Dealer With Monster Contracts

Simple mobile to give the monster contracts to players.
To add the mobile in game simply use
[add MonsterContractDealer

To add the contract it self in game use
[add MonsterContract

The monster contract is a deed that will display how many 
and what kind of monster you need to kill and then get the
reward from it, the type and amount of monsters to kill is totaly random
so you will not take the same deed and monster the same time
twice.

FYI: I did not write the monster contract, but i did do the npc for it
if you find any bugs, exploit or suggestion let us know. Enjoy!
