Security Guard Vendor
*based on Erica's OSI Monk Robe Vendor*

Just something I threw together tonight for those shards that run casinos.

Needs Erica's Monk Robe which can be found at the following location:

Simply unzip to your custom scripts location and restart your server.  Add a spawner to your casino locations to spawn a security guard.

This security guard sells the following items:
Commodity Deeds
Backpacks
Pouches
Bags
Recall Runes
Bandages
Quarterstaff
