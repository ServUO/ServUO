	You may only change the values between the '>' and '<' characters to set the configuratoin

	the user. Array element names are also meaningless.  Values may be left empty, with the
	exception of individual array elements, so that the default value in the code is used.
	
	For example: to change the foo configuration from 50 to 100 one would change
		<foo type="int">50</foo>
			to
		<foo type="int">100</foo>
